### Welcome to my project 2!


I am quickly learning how to create and manipulate features of a page to visualize information and create meaningful data experiences. Unfortunately, this project does not work quite as well as I had hoped (I was in the process of adding extinction events when the deadline arrived), but it is at the very least an interesting visualization of the California Current Ecosystem.
