            The California Current System is characterized by cold water, deep bathymetry, and 
            seasonal upwelling. The upwelling events make this coastline one of the most 
            productive in the world. Kelp forests are one type of ecosystem that exists within
            this current. They are vast fields of kelp that can reach as tall as 60 meters,
            providing not just nourishment, but shelter and structure for tens of thousands of
            other species.

            <br><br>

            This network displays a food web of a kelp forest ecosystem at the phylogenetic class 
            level. For example, the dark red bubble "Mammalia" represents all the marine mammals 
            in this kelp forest: whales, dolphins, otters, orcas, seals, sea lions, 
            and more. The lines connecting the bubbles represent consumption, where one organism 
            consumes the other. 

            <br><br>

            The ecosystem is balanced, because each group of organisms relies on the ones below 
            it on the food chain to survive. In some cases, the existence of the entire system 
            can rely on a specific species to keep the balance. These are called "keystone 
            species". Right-click on the bubbles to remove them and find out which two of these 
            groups contain keystone species.
